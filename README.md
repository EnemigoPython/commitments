# commitments
Daily task logger in Tkinter

Creates a window to create & log daily tasks (commitments) which are saved locally to a CSV file.

# features/configuration

-Automatically obtains the date each time the program is opened (UK time format). New row created for each day (including when multiple days have elapsed between running).

-STRICT: You can only log events for the present day. If you don't log a commitment by the end of the day, the program assumes you didn't do that commitment and logs it as a failure to complete.

-Reset the CSV file with 'New CSV'.
